#NoteCatcher

The application will allow user to record any sound/note in daily life to match a set of
notes and use them to form a tune. The idea is to add as many interesting sounds as
possible to form several amazing musical combination.

The application will include an icon for user to record whatever the sound they want.
After pressing the record button, users will record and save a short clip of audio and the
application will automatically detect their pitches and generate several notes from the
clip. This will be the main feature of this application. Any note that has been detected
will be automatically saved to the SD card. Once all the notes required by a piece of
music have been detected and saved, the user will be able to play the music.

Our goal is to encourage people to go outside, discover and catch any interesting
sound in their real life to formulate a song. We also aim to motivate people who does
not sing well to practice singing and become a better singer. These two kinds of people
will become our potential users.
